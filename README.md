# Tableau Proofs

Generate tableau proofs of any proposition.

To run, simply run texProof p s, where p is the proposition and s is the string representing the file name where the tableau proof will be written.
First the proposition gets proven, and then it gets translated into a latex bussproof which then gets compiled as a pdf.
